## OOPCGL mini project: 2D and 3D Animation

This Project is a 2d and 3d Animator which lets user draw and animate various shapes.

> Note : This uses OpenGL Libraries and the built-in functions 

> Also : We are following the Object-Oriented Approach in the Program.
---

We will be working with 3 shapes :
1. Square
2. Triangle 
3. Circle

---

For the 2D Animations -- We will have 3 options :
1. Translating
2. Scaling
3. Rotating

---

For 3D animations -- We will have _ options :
....

---

### Workflow :
1. User selects the shape
2. User selects the animation type
3. User enters the animation parameters (e.g. translation, scaling, rotation)
4. The program generates the animation and displays it.

---

## Program approach :
We will use the following approach :
1. Create a class for each shape (Square, Triangle, Circle)
2. Create a class for each animation type (Translation, Scaling, Rotation)
3. Create a class for the animator
4. In the animator class, we will have a method to draw the shape
5. In the animator class, we will have a method to animate the shape
6. In the animator class, we will have a method to display the animation
